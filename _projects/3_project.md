title: Meteors and Deep Q-Learning
description: In this project, I created an RL agent that is able to play the game, Meteors. I used the python Arcade library to create the game from scratch. I used Deep Q-Learning to train the RL agent in this project. I experimented with various improvements of DQN and tested how those improvements worked out in playing Meteors.
