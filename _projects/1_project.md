title: TGR
description: TGR is a Raspberry Pi (4B) based 4wd robot created for real-world ML/RL-based projects. The robot can perform the line-following task using the camera image, and the robot can be controlled using an Android App. I plan to implement projects involving ML and RL using the robot.
