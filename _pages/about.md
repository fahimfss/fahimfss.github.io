Hi!

I am Fahim, an M.Sc. student and a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Alberta. I am currently working under the supervision of Professor <a href='https://armahmood.github.io/'>A. Rupam Mahmood</a> with the <a href='http://rlai.ualberta.ca/'>Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence (RLAI)</a> Lab.  My research topic is reinforcement learning with physical robots. I am interested in vision-based reinforcement learning and have worked with the <a href='https://wiredworkers.io/cobot-brands/cobot-franka-emika-panda/'>Franka Emika Panda</a> robotic arm, and the <a href='https://edu.irobot.com/what-we-offer/create-robot'>iRobot Create 2</a>  robot.  

Before attending UAlberta, I worked as a lecturer at the <a href='https://www.uiu.ac.bd/'>United International University</a> (UIU) for three and a half years. I taught Object Oriented Programming with Java and Data Structure and Algorithms courses at UIU. 

I love to code, work with robots and play games. During my undergrad at United International University, I attended numerous programming competitions. After joining UIU, I created a 4WD robot (<a href='https://github.com/fahimfss/TGR'>TGR</a> ) from scratch using Raspberry Pi 4 and C++ as a personal project. I love playing strategy games (Anno, StarCraft), Dota 2, and I occasionally play FPS games.
